# User Stories (As many as you want. Delete the statements you don't need)
# As a user, I want to add items to my list
# As a user, I want to check-off items from my list
# As a user, I want to display the items from my list
# As a user, I want to specify quantities of items on my list

 
# Pseudocode
# Variables -- list, and checked_list (hashes)
# 

# Create class List
#  METHOD initialize that takes two arguments (item(s) and quantity default set to 1
#  assign instance variables 
#  @list = new hash
#  @item = item
#  @quantity = quantity
#  END METHOD
#
#  METHOD add_item takes a two arguments
#    push item and quantity to list hash
#  END METHOD
#
#  METHOD remove_item which takes a single argument
#    remove item from list hash
#  END METHOD
#
#  METHOD display_items which takes no arguements
#   puts "list contains"
#   displays list hash
#  END METHOD
#  
#  
# Your fabulous code goes here....

# class List
#   def initialize
#     @list = Hash.new
#   end
  
#   def add_item(item,quantity=1)
#     @list[item] = quantity 
#   end

#   def remove_item(item)
#     if @list.include?(item)
#       @list.delete(item)
#     else
#       p "These aren't the droids your looking for..."
#     end
#   end  
    
#   def display_items
#     if @list.empty? 
#       puts "Your list contains no items!"
#     else
#       @list.each { |key,value| puts "#{key}: #{value}\n" }
#     end
#   end

# end


# REFACTOR
# Wound up refactoring and playing with driver code instead of refactoring 
# script. Sorry :+)
