# U3.W7: Modeling a Real-World Database (SOLO CHALLENGE)

## Release 0: Users Fields
Photo, Header, Name, Location, Website, Bio, Facebook

## Release 1: Tweet Fields
tweet, photo, location

## Release 2: Explain the relationship
The relationship between `users` and `tweets` is: user(implied), photo and location.
I say user because only the user will be able to tweet from this account. As for the other two, those are the only fields that match here. Obvisouly, these fields could be identical, OR they could be different every time.
