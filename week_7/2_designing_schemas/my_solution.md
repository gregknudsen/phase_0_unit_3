## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
One to one: Just a simple schema demonstrating there is one order per customer.

Many to many: Using the same basic idea of the author schema, I just put in architects for world structures.

## Release 5: Reflection

Navigating the Socrates Schema Designer took just a little bit of time to get used to, but once I got the hang of it, implementing releases 0-3 were pretty straight forward. Designing my own took a little bit longer. The many to many, for whatever reason, took far less time for me. Maybe it was because it more closely resembled the authors schema provided. I think it also works well for architects and their structures. The one to one took a bit of time just to think of something. Luckily, I was in Panera when I did this, and it seemed like a pretty clear decision. :)
