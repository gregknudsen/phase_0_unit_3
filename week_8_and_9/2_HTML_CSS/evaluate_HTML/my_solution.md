## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

	You said it...it is a nightmare to read. Something happened with my text editor about 50 lines down where I lost the red color coding to indicate the ends of rows, tables, etc, so it made it vritually impossible to keep reformatting the page to make it read eaiser. There are A LOT of CSS and JS embedded lines that make things that much more confusing. I think doing that on a limited basis is better. The first 40 lines or so are VERY hard to read and organize because of that fact.
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

	Hate it lol. See answer to #1. They may have used IDs and Classes properly, but the names are not clear and only add to the confusion.

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

	Not really. The inline use of all the tags make for very confusin reading. It also is not very semantic. There are no header tags, for example, to indicate what might need more attention.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

	There seemed to be no formtting whatsoever. Speed is their first priority, it seems. Looking at the html file, line 51 is more like 50 lines of code smashed into one statement. And in the css file, all the expressions are on one line...again, very confusing.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?

	The use of the JS was confusing at first. I think I formatted that to look a little better. And the fact that I lose the red tags in the mish mash of line 51 is very confusing.
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
	Inline and not DRY. I see several different selectors for the same elements. BOG no no.
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?

	Yes, it seems line 52 deals with that.
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

	Not very good to me. I guess I say that as a novice who doesn't immediately recognize a lot of the techniques here. I've read a lot that when one programs, they should program for other people, not computers, as there will always be other people that will eventually look at the code. This is certainly not an example of that philosophy.


## REFLECTION

	Again, I'll reiterate that it is my intention to program for other people, not machines. While the latter may be quicker and shorter, the process needed to fix bugs (I couldn't even complete the reformatting of the HTML page!) will add far more time than the gains from the 'shorthand' programming. Obviously, speed is important too, and a balance will have to be struck eventually. I still believe that the more people understand what you're trying to say with your code, the better things will be.
